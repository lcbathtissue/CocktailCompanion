# THIS IS AN EXAMPLE README FROM ANOTHER REPO
# MINI HACKATHON - GROUP 15
This project demonstrates the ability to work with binary numbers in Java, including performing basic arithmetic operations on them. The program includes a Binary class with a constructor that stores a binary number as a String and truncates any leading zeros. It also includes methods such as getValue() to return the binary number as a string and add() to perform a bitwise add on two Binary objects and return a new Binary object representing the result.

The project also includes a JUnit test class, BinaryTest.java, that tests the functionality of the Binary class and its methods.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through deploying the Binary Calculator app using Kubernetes on Google Cloud Platform.

### Prerequisites

- Google Cloud Platform account
- Kubernetes CLI (kubectl) installed
- Docker installed

### Deploying using commands

Clone the repository to your local machine:<br>
`git clone https://github.com/<username>/BinaryCalculator.git`

Navigate to the project directory:<br>
`cd BinaryCalculator`

Compile and package the project using Maven:<br>
`mvn clean package`

Build the Docker image and push it to Google Cloud Registry:<br>
`docker build -t gcr.io/<Project-ID>/binarycalculator .` <br>
`docker push gcr.io/<Project-ID>/binarycalculator`

Create a Kubernetes deployment:<br>
`kubectl create deployment binarycalculator-deployment --image gcr.io/<Project-ID>/binarycalculator --port=8080`

Expose the deployment as a LoadBalancer service:<br>
`kubectl expose deployment binarycalculator-deployment --type=LoadBalancer --name=binarycalculator-service`

Wait for the external IP address to be assigned to the service:<br>
`kubectl get services --watch` <br>
Note the external IP address assigned to the service.

Access the Binary Calculator app using the external IP address:<br>
`http://<External-IP-Address>:8080/`

### Deploying using YAML file

Clone the repository to your local machine:<br>
`git clone https://github.com/<username>/BinaryCalculator.git`

Navigate to the project directory:<br>
`cd BinaryCalculator`

Compile and package the project using Maven:<br>
`mvn clean package`

Build the Docker image and push it to Google Cloud Registry:<br>
`docker build -t gcr.io/<Project-ID>/binarycalculator .` <br>
`docker push gcr.io/<Project-ID>/binarycalculator`

Deploy the app using the binary-calculator.yaml file:<br>
`kubectl apply -f binary-calculator.yaml`

Wait for the external IP address to be assigned to the service:<br>
`kubectl get services --watch` <br>
Note the external IP address assigned to the service.

Access the Binary Calculator app using the external IP address:<br>
`http://<External-IP-Address>:8080/`
